    <h2>Van</h2>
    <p>Regarding what I thought went well during this assignment, practical planning of short-term tasks throughout the week, as well as being able to plan for the long term had a positive impression on me. I thought this was especially true during the tutorial. I also thought the process of team management from Bo was fair, concise and practical which also had a positive impression from me. Although the planning of the assignment was conceived from the beginning, we ran into quite a few roadblocks pertaining to progression and communication. Although running into troubles in completing tasks is understandable, communicating one's current progress as well as formulating it concretely in forms of uploading iterations of a task would have been helpful for all members in understanding our overall progress in the assignment, and ultimately, help avoid the need for "crunch time". This attribute of having work delayed for extended periods of time with no updates was also one of the things I found surprising from this assignment and has provided a good opportunity to learn more about team management and communication skills. Another aspect that I found surprising is the constant rearranging of team members, with 2 different team members that left midway. I have learned that every team is unique, and an important part of success correlates more with frequent communication, rather than technical abilities.</p>

    <h2>Daniel</h2>
    <p>I think what went well in the group was our consistency, we strived to meet once or twice a week and pretty much all these meetings went ahead on time with almost all group members involved. I also think that task allocation went to the most fit people to do these jobs, admittedly I’m not the most technical of people so having me do something like work on the HTML of the website (something I originally wanted to do) would’ve been admittedly a very bad idea, instead that job went to Russell, a literal professional web developer, and we didn’t even have to pay him. What could’ve been improved is everyone’s commitment to this assignment, I am not excluded from this criticism, I mentioned previously that almost everyone was present at meetings, admittedly there weren’t too many meetings were all five of us were present which made things like checking progress difficult at times. Something I found surprising was the amount of work that was required for this assignment in general, as well as the general formality of all the meetings. One major thing I’ve learned about groups is being in a group where each member has a different level of motivation to the goal can be incredibly frustrating.</p>

    <h2>Hayden</h2>
    <p>I think the team went well. We did rush a bit at the end but I think everything came together. Everyone contributed which was good and I could really make comparisons to my work environment. I also think I can apply what I learned here in my other team projects. I have also been able to apply my knowledge with CSS and HTML when making the group website which I thought was great. I admit, work and other subjects have made it hard for me to when balancing between obligations. I also agree with what the others have said about better communication and hope we can do better in the next assessment. This point of finding work/life balance was also surprising to me. I did not expect this assignment to take as long as it has. I have learnt that each group is unique. I also think that we should consider the capabilities and availability of each member when assigning tasks and hope we can work better as a group in the future.</p>
    <br></br>
    <h2>Russell</h2>
    <p>With what went well with this group, we were pretty quick to agree on what task each of us would take on and volunteer for. There was some good plans at the start but with most of us not participating in the first few weeks, we fell behind. Overall, I think we could have done better as a team. Most of us haven’t been very reliable when it came to meeting deadlines and updating each other on our progress. I personally hadn’t participated as much in the meetings as I should have though I did my complete the work on time. I do have high praises for Bo since it’s been rough for him to lead and has been a crucial part making sure our team were on track to complete our assignment. Because most of us were missing deadlines and weren’t contributing much, this ended up with the whole team having to “crunch” to finish our assignment. What I found surprising was just how far behind we fell behind on the assignment until the very end. It has at least been a good learning experience on how we can do better for the next assignment and hopefully our team dynamic will be more relaxed. If we can focus on addressing our issues like participation and contribution, I fully believe that we might have a smoother time in Assignment 3. </p>
    <br></br>
    <h2>Bo</h2>
    <p>My overall perception of the team has been negative. Firstly, each member of the team possesses unique skills which complements the other members and covers our weaknesses. Hayden and Russell both possess in-depth knowledge and experience with front-end development, website creation and programming. Van showed a great ability in researching and writing his ideas/findings in a clear professional manner. Daniel demonstrated the ability to have meaningful discussions during tutorials to generate ideas and concepts. This was a great advantage that we unfortunately failed to utilise the full potential of. During our assignment, we have had an ongoing issue of participation, organisation, and fulfilment of deadlines. Some members were not participating in meetings and in some cases the tutorial sessions. Combined with a lack of communication, this led to confusion of our expectations and a lack of direction. Progress was severely lacking for the first few weeks of the assignment and deadlines were not being met. What resulted from this is a crunch period dangerously close to our A2 submission deadline. Working with this group has been valuable experience especially as a leader. I believe if we address these issues and utilise our advantage of our team skillsets, A3 should be much easier to tackle. </p>
    <h2>Overall Group</h2>
    <p>As a team, we found that we were at the very least consistent in with holding 2 meetings a week. We recognised also that some members held excellent skills and were better suited for certain roles and tasks. With this recognition, the task allocation was more efficient, playing to our member’s strengths rather than weaknesses. However, the team collectively identified that we have lots of aspects to improve on. A lack of participation and commitment were one of our biggest flaws that has led to several issues. This led to communication confusion within the team, lack of progress and eventually the necessity for a “crunch” period. Additionally, outstanding tasks for sections that were prioritised and conceptualised to be finished in the early stages of the assignment largely remained incomplete. In turn, the later stages of the assignment were also intervened by the need to address and complete said tasks.</p>
    <p>Regarding the positives of the team dynamic, we have a diverse range of skills, from technical to non-technical. For instance, delegating Russell to the website design or having Bo manage the team environment allowed for a more optimised allocation of resources. The planning of tasks was smooth and practical, however, flaws in transparent communication and commitment from the collective proved to hinder our execution and consequently, the completion of the assignment in the later stages of the deadline made it more stressful than it needed to be. Therefore, as a team, more clarity needs to be addressed in communication as well as its frequency on teams. Further improvements could include incorporation of tools such as Trello when creating and assigning tasks, which also provides a supplementary system for progress management.</p>
    <p>One aspect that the team found surprising would be the difficulty of operating in a team environment, especially an informal environment with people skilled in different areas. Making sure every member was up to speed and was working on their assigned tasks, with endeavours to reduce procrastination proved difficult to manage and caught many off guard with the amount of work left to be completed juxtaposed to the encroaching deadline. Interestingly, this point was a point of learning for the team. The efforts and enthusiasm of a team member can positively affect the whole team and contrastingly, the slack and last-minute attitude to a single member, has an adverse effect on the collective group, and often to a greater extent to its positive.</p>
    <p>With the advent of the third and final assessment, we intend to make drastic changes to the groups structure and the way we perform and execute objectives from the lessons learned from this assignment.  </p>
