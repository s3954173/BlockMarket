      <h3>Bo Kim Tran (S3954173)</h3>
      <img src="images/boprofile.png" alt="Bo's Profile">
      <h4>My website: <a href="https://s3954173.github.io/COSC1078-Assignment-1/">https://s3954173.github.io/COSC1078-Assignment-1/</a></h4>

      <p>I was born in Australia but have a half-Chinese and half-Vietnamese ethnicity. In 2019, I undertook a traineeship with Apprenticeship Support Australia. Since then, I have been working as a Client Service Officer providing crucial support to
        businesses and apprentices especially during COVID and being responsible for administering government subsidies to clients. Some of my hobbies include experimenting with programming languages and playing games like Elden Ring. I especially
        love going on walks with my pet dog Vilo (see below for maximum adorableness!)</p>
      <p>I have a fair amount of IT experience in terms of what I have learnt or have been exposed to. I have dabbled with Python, Raspberry Pis, building computers, configuring networks, playing VR games and have been continuously exploring the
        different options available in the IT industry. </p>
      <p>At work, I occasionally become the de facto “IT guy” when the IT department is not available. My current number one interest in IT has been cybersecurity and ethical hacking. It started with prospects of high pay and being the ‘Hacker Man.’
        However, further research into this industry gave me motivation to learn vital skills and knowledge to protect myself, my family, and others from the constant threats we face online. Also having legally immunity (when granted by the client)
        to break into people’s things sounds like fun.  </p>

      <img src="images/botest3.png" alt="Bo's Personality Test - Big Five">

      <p>My ‘16 Personalities’ test summarised me as a Logistician. This type of personality is known to be reliable they can stay focused and logical even during high intense situations. My learning style test showed I was primarily a kinesthetic
        learner meaning I prefer learning new concepts by experiencing and experimenting with them without reading up on these concepts. Finally, in the ‘Big Five’ test, it showed I am a self-driven individual who focuses on completing his duties
        without compromising his morals and assume a leadership role for group work.</p>
      <p>A key point I understood from my test outcomes which may be useful to my team, is that I would assume the leadership role and duties in the team. Furthermore, my potential effectiveness as a leader is enhanced by my capability to manage
        stressful situations and remained focused on the task at hand. This means I can effectively manage and organise the team to complete tasks on schedule, delegate duties, and ensure members are contributing. This thereby can reduce panic and
        stress from disorganisation, having too much of a workload, or last-minute assignment rushes. This will also provide opportunities for our work to be reviewed and improved before submission. </p>

      <p>Hello, I am Daniel Gell, a member of the Block Market team, my student number is s3944942, and I’ve just moved to Melbourne this year (2022) for university, previously residing in the Gippsland town of Rosedale. My main hobby is music, I’ve
        been playing guitar for nearly a decade, and have picked up various other instruments throughout the years. I am also an avid collector of music, with a collection of CDs, vinyl records, and cassette tapes amassing about 350 albums in total.
        My
        interest in IT mostly stemmed from my year 12 IT teacher, Mr Donald Watson, he was very informative in how he taught and it gave me a love of IT that I still have till this day. I have little to no actual practical experience in IT however,
        aside from a few data entry jobs I did for my mother’s bookkeeping company.</p>

      <ul>
        <p>Myers-Briggs personality type: ENTP-T</p>
        <p>Apparently I’m a debater, meaning I should be good in a team for
          challenging other people’s ideas if I don’t think they would work,
          allowing me to be a useful tool in our team’s arsenal by not allowing
          other people’s ideas to go unchallenged, leading us to a higher
          standard of work.</p>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <p>Learning type: Auditory/Tactile Learner</p>
        <p>I learn best by doing things myself, which allows me to experiment
          with trial and error to get the best results in any new skills that we
          are taking on for our task. For example HTML, I just started making
          my assignment 1 website with no prior experience and just learned it
          all as I went, rather than watching a video and seeing all the
          possibilities of HTML.
        </p>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <p>Creativity Test: 66.43% creative</p>
        <p>This means that I am above average creatively, so I should have
          more of a hand in the creative side of things, such as the website
          design. And in our groups having someone who is less creative and
          sees things more in black and white could ground me a bit to ensure
          my ideas aren’t too far-fetched out and out there.</p>

      <h3>Russell Saw (S3935418)</h3>
      <img src="images/russellprofile.png" alt="Russell's Profile">
      <h4>My website: <a href="https://sviozrsx29.github.io/COS1078_Assignment1/">https://sviozrsx29.github.io/COS1078_Assignment1/</a></h4>

      <p>Greetings! My name is Russell Saw and I am currently a student studying a Bachelor of IT in RMIT. I am Malaysian-Chinese by decent but have spent most of my childhood growing up in Melbourne (migrated at the end of 04) – and thus have
        adopted
        a strong Australian culture – with some Asian roots. While almost exclusively speaking English with friends and family, I can understand slight amounts of Cantonese and Chinese – something I’d love to expand by understanding on. My past
        education consists of a finished VCE (Highvale Secondary), 4 years of undergrad experience (Design at melbuni / IT at monash) and now finally finishing a Bachelor of IT at RMIT.</p>
      <p>If not seen at my desk job as a junior front-end developer or studying for my degree, you can catch me practising guitar or playing badminton. Videogames have, and always been, a huge part of my life. Sinking ungodly hours into gradually
        increasing an otherwise ineffectual number that supposedly quantifies your overall skill and competency - dota2 anyone?</p>
      <p>From an early age, IT has always been a major component of my life. Everything from playing video game consoles, the exchange of information through social medias, to my ever-growing curiosity of AI have shaped me to become the individual I
        am. My early childhood affinity with computer games had led me to become inevitably attached to PC’s. As you grow up with constantly updated hardware – and ever-increasing capabilities, your curiosity of what is possible, and what can be
        created with these machines stands as a driving factor for my pursuit in a career in IT. Whether these limits are explored through means as a software developer, security architect or even a path in data analytics, is yet to be realised. My
        hopes in completing my course in RMIT, is that I will learn in which of these fields my passion in IT lies. I currently have hands-on experience with IT, recently starting my job as a junior web developer, working within a dev team
        collaboratively to code the front-end of an e-commerce website to be used commercially.</p>
      <p>My own skills and qualifications are somewhat related and begin to explore what is required for this ideal job. I am currently finishing my Bachelor of IT as my tertiary education.  In terms of coding ability, I understand the fundamental
        principles of how some coding languages work, including HTML, CSS, JS and TS. I have had real-world experience applying these languages in developing websites. I have also had experience in completing courses in mobile app development
        (Android
        studio) which include development in the front and back-end (storing data using MongoDB SQL).</p>
      <p>In terms of field experience, there is limited and junior experience as a developer, using libraries such as angular and RxJS to develop. As I work in the front-end, I am always considering the UX and using a user-centred approach to my
        designs.  I have had prior tertiary experience in a Bachelor of Design, drawing upon design elements and principles learnt in my time learning architecture – which are all transferable skills which can be applied to digital UI design.
        Personally, I have always had an eye for design, constantly finding the imperfections in current everyday applications and services – thinking about the “what ifs?” and the reimagining in my own style.</p>

      <img src="images/vanprofile.png" alt="Van's Profile">
      <h4>My website: <a href="https://phamilyvan.github.io/COSC---IIT---Assignment-1/">https://phamilyvan.github.io/COSC---IIT---Assignment-1/</a></h4>

      <p>My name is Van Pham, student number s3788106, email of s3788106@student.rmit.edu.au and studying in Bachelor of Information Technology. I was previously enrolled in Computer Science but opted to change courses. The reasons being: Enrolling
        in
        a program that is more suited towards my capabilities and freeing up time to pursue other professional interests (being data analytics and data science) as well as leisure.</p>
      <p>Born in Australia with a Vietnamese background, I can speak English, Vietnamese and in the recent years, have picked up Japanese. A fact that one might find interesting about me is that I’m an avid gamer, especially the genres of
        First-Person
        Shooters and Role-Playing Games. My favourite titles are “Counter-Strike Global Offensive” and “Skyrim”.</p>
      <p>Before starting my studies at RMIT, whenever the term “IT” came up in conversation, I would always think of Artificial Intelligent Systems, Machine Learning and an Interconnected world using Technology. Those assumptions were heavily
        influenced by Japanese films such as “Ghost in the shell” and “Time of Eve” as well as games like “Deus Ex”. The conceptualisation of what a future society that is intertwined with technology has fascinated me ever since enjoying these medias
        a
        few years back. Rather than just watching by the sideline, pursuing a career in IT, where I could create these technologies seemed much more appealing to me, hence my enrolment at RMIT.</p>
      <p>After having studied for a couple of years with exposure to software development using Java, Databases and many other disciplines, my interest (much the same as before studying at RMIT) largely remains the same in Artificial Intelligence,
        Machine Learning and Data Analytics. More specifically, I would someday like to create a self-thinking, intelligent system. Examples of developments in Artificial Intelligence that has piqued my interest in recent years includes Tesla’s
        self-driving cars, the robot Sophia and OpenAI’s Dota 2 AI.</p>

      <p>My test results may be helpful to my team as it provides an indication of the points in which may cause issues such as lack of communication as a trait from being introverted. Additionally, the Big 5 Personality Test described me as being
        50%
        conscientious which has implications regarding motivation and discipline. This may cause issues when it comes to deliverables. These points provide an opportunity to improve and manage said flaws.</p>

    <h2>IT WORK</h2>
    <p>For our choice of an IT professional, we decided to interview Glenn Goodwin - Executive Director of Information, Communication and Technology at the Victorian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Glenn is also an advisor on two advisory boards
      for the Australian Cyber Security Centre and RMIT Centre for Cyber Security Research and Innovation.</p>
    <img src="images/interviewprofile.png" alt="Interviewee Profile">
    <p>Glenn Goodwin’s LinkedIn Profile: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/glenngoodwinau/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/glenngoodwinau/</a></p>

    <p>We conducted a half-hour interview with Glenn, asking a range of questions about his role, work, interactions, challenges, and insights. It was an extremely valuable experience, having the opportunity to gain first-hand impressions from an
      executive role in IT, as opposed to managerial, senior, or entry-level roles.</p>

    <p>Glenn works in the Corporate ICT industry, which is primarily focused on maintaining and improving the ICT components of a company. The overview of his role and duties was extremely broad and intensive. Firstly, he is involved in every IT
      component in an organisation, whether this would be networking, enterprise solutions, software development, procuring devices etc. As he put it informally, “If it’s got a plug in it, it’s my problem.” Therefore, it is necessary that he has a
      foundational understanding of all aspects of ICT to perform his role effectively.</p>

    <p>When enquired about his primary focus in his duties, he answered “Can I say all of the above?” signifying just how important every aspect of his duties is.</p>
    <p>One of his main duties he expanded upon involves managing human resources, resource allocation, and budgeting for the IT department. He must ensure his department delivers on their outcomes, have the capacity and resources to deliver
      effectively, and are heading in the right strategic direction. He also has staff run day-to-day projects and sets daily goals/tasks for the teams to achieve. Glenn mentioned however, that he leaves the decision-making of how they achieve these
      goals to his teams and their managers.</p>

    <p>Stakeholder management and engagement are another key duty Glenn’s role spends majority of its time on. Glenn advised that at a senior level, good relationship management is a must-have to succeed. His primary interactions are with internal
      stakeholders. The nature of the Corporate ICT industry focuses most interactions with other teams within the organisation and ensure the delivery of their needs and vision. These interactions are broad and typically address any IT issues or
      requirements these teams have.</p>

    <p>However, it was specified that within any organisation, there are usually 4 individuals to prioritise and ensure their satisfaction. Number one is the CEO, an immediate priority to attend whenever there is a tech issue. Glenn highlighted the
      urgency and importance of these cases, saying “I’ll go heaven and earth to get his laptop working.” He went further to explain that if the CEO is unhappy with their performance, then the jobs of the IT department are at risk. Number two is the
      CFO, who is responsible for the overall finances and budget of the entire company. The IT department spends a significant amount of money and resources, therefore an uneasy relationship with the CFO is ill-advised. It can potentially lead to
      not having an approved budget, resulting in the IT department not delivering on their outcomes, and eventually even the loss of their jobs. Number three was the Corporate Service Manager or whoever the IT department reports to. In Glenn’s
      current job, he reports directly to the CEO. Surprisingly, number four was the Executive Assistant (EA) to the CEO. Glenn has personally witnessed in his previous roles, individuals losing their jobs because the EA could not print their
      documents or could not perform other tasks due to tech issues. When the EA is unhappy, they complain to the CEO, and when the CEO is unhappy, this can again lead to people losing their jobs.</p>

    <p>Typically, there are not any interactions with clients or investors in the Corporate ICT industry. External stakeholders that the role primarily interacts with are external providers such as telecommunication companies or website developers
      and other IT professionals. These stakeholders are particularly important to deliver solutions that the team do not specialise in and/or cannot deliver themselves. One of the difficulties Glenn faces for this task, is ensuring that
      products/services he contracts and purchases, are being delivered at a cost at value.</p>

    <p>Firstly, this means finding good providers, pay them fairly, and ensure they will deliver effectively. This requirement necessitates maintaining a balance between holding providers to account and being lenient. An aggressive approach with
      providers can lead to them cutting corners and delivering lower quality products and services. This type of approach is typically avoided since providers can do the same in reverse and therefore impede the capacity for the IT teams to deliver
      outcomes.</p>

    <p>On an individual basis with other IT professionals, Glenn’s success managing these relationships is attributed to building trust, networking, and fair treatment over the course of many years. A concept and strategy Glenn advises to employ is
      to be positive and encouraging to these IT professionals. He explains that most IT professionals do not react well when pushed too much. This can often lead to them delivering less/lower quality service than expected. By being more positive,
      encouraging, and playing to their egos, Glenn has had many successes leading these IT professionals to deliver a greater product and service.</p>

    <p>Due to the nature of the role, the tools typically used are HR/management related. The tools used to achieve all these goals and tasks are primarily the Microsoft Office Suite. Word is used for writing up documents and reports, Outlook for
      emails and Teams for Meetings. Collaborative tools, task tracking tools, and project management tools are also deployed such as Azure DevOps. Glenn occasionally springs from different tools depending on the nature of the task but he mostly
      avoids any task-based tools like Visio or Visual Studio which his teams often use.</p>

    <p>When asked what the most challenging aspect of his role was, Glenn answered the following. "The natural enemy of IT, ... is the marketing team” and they are “bleeding edge.” It was described as an insurmountable challenge to deliver upon the
      marketing team’s needs and vision. This challenge was noted to be present in almost any job in the IT industry. The marketing team have extremely high visions and expectations, demanding the latest state-of-the-art technology, whilst
      complaining that friends or other organisations like Google have them. Furthermore, the IT department have a priority to deal with ‘hygiene’ issues like allocating laptops to staff as opposed to marketing’s request to implement QR codes or
      purchase VR headsets. This thereby leads to the marketing team’s dissatisfaction with the IT department for not delivering upon their requests and vision.</p>

    <p>Closer to the end of the interview, we started asking about Glenn’s insights on a few upcoming IT industries/aspects. These included Cyber Security, emerging technologies, and AI.</p>
    <p>On Cyber Security, we were optimistic for his insight especially given his secondary role as an advisor for two advisory boards for cyber security. Glenn did not disappoint, providing an answer that we would not normally find from online
      research. He stated that for cyber security, “We’re in the 1920s with motor vehicles.” and “still a little bit in the Wild West”. The context of this statement was that during that period, there were no compliance standards that needed to be
      followed. One could simply "start your own car manufacturing business... And a few people would dry along the way.”
      With a new industry that is still evolving, Glenn believes that compliance is the direction that cyber security will evolve to as well as the enforcement of compliance. Like engineers who cannot build a bridge without adhering to guidelines and
      standards, we will reach the same stage when developing software solutions. We will have to adhere to compliance and standards, lest we face severe consequences such as contempt or jail.</p>
    <p>Currently we are at the stage where companies are pushing responsibilities on users, stating that the user needs to be trained more. Glenn compared this to another scenario where “It’s like going to the dentist and the dentist saying... You
      need to become an expert in dentistry to look after your own teeth and everybody would just laugh and say that’s ludicrous.” Glenn concluded like the automotive or engineering industries, the expectation and vision for cyber security is that
      “we need to move away from blaming the users for breaches... and we need to hold companies accountable.”</p>

    <p>When asked about emerging technologies and any he believed might have a revolutionary effect, Glenn stated that he felt there is not anything revolutionary yet. Based on his personal experience and observations, the IT development scene has
      slowed down quite a lot, and in general, new emerging technologies are marketed very well, but they are not delivering as expected. He highlighted his feelings on cryptocurrency especially, feeling that it was a “solution looking for a problem
      rather than actually...solve something real world.”</p>

    <p>Finally on AI, in which most have concerns for a Terminator-like future, Glenn shed some light on this industry and concern. Though true AI may in fact be potentially deadly as many imagine, he explained that current AI are not anywhere close
      to this future. At its current stage, AI is really an evolution of sophisticated pattern matching and is not true awareness or learning. On the visions and expectations to how AI would impact our future, it was highlighted that many road jobs,
      low-skilled roles, and production lines would be replaced by robots since they would be more effective and cost-efficient. Though these types of junior roles would start to disappear, "what we’re ending up with is more skilled, … knowledgeable
      roles that we need to replace them.” This means high-skills roles where they program, maintain or diagnose these AI tools will be in high demand. Based on this, we can expect a future where we may provide more support and incentives for people
      to start working or transition into these types of role.</p>
