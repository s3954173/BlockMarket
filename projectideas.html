    <h2>Overview</body>h2>
    <p>For our group project, we have decided to develop Hayden’s Productivity Software with a few extra features inspired from Bo’s A1 Study Assist Application. The primary focus will be on project management and note taking in a collaborative real-time editor. With an estimated “1.4 million local and international students” (Facts & Publications – Universities Australia, 2022). Globally, the productivity software market (currently worth AUD $66.551 billion) expected to grow 14% per year up to 2030 (Productivity Management Software Market Report, 2030, 2022), it is a prime opportunity to develop a project targeted towards these audience and market.</p>

    <p>Major features of the app will include functions for time management, note taking, project management, document file management, and team communication. The delivery of these functions will take inspiration from both Hayden’s and Bo’s project ideas, implementing the best ideas from both projects. Extra features such as an in-built media player, contact book, assignment tracker and follow ups from Bo’s project would be included it increase the appeal and functionality of the application. The project aims to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of both an individual’s and group’s productivity.</p>

    <p>The success of the project is based on the goal of meeting a niche amongst our target audience. This niche refers to available applications lacking the versatility to solve all student needs and issue. Furthermore, working towards this niche keeps competition down low especially with an already dominated productivity software market.  </p>

    <p>The project was initially to be built as a desktop application. However, further discussion led us to start building a web-based application with the capacity to transition to a desktop or mobile application. Initial discussions on the application designs will primarily be inspired by Notion though elements of Microsoft OneNote will also be used as inspiration too.</p>
</div>

    <h2>Motivation </h2>
    <p>There are some reasons involved to developing this project. Firstly, is the potential to enter the rapidly growing productivity software market that has a high net worth. It presents future opportunities to capitalise on the growing success of the market and thereby becoming successful ourselves. This market is dominated by Microsoft OneNote and Notion, presenting another opportunity to deliver a cheaper alternative solution with features those other applications may lack. It is however extremely ambitious to believe that our project could compete with these companies. Therefore, it is better for the project to be geared towards a specific audience such as school/university students for increased future success. Excluding the productivity software market and target audience of school/university students, the scope of the project is broad enough to shift focus on other potential markets we have not explored yet.</p>

    <p>There is also motivation from our first-hand experiences with currently available productivity and time-management apps as students. Students have many aspects to manage such as time-management, note-taking, and project/assignment management. There are a variety of apps available dedicated one of these aspects, but the main issue is that is a lack of apps designed to include both aspects together. App choice variety is important and often enjoyed, but it does become tedious and time-consuming having to switch between apps just to use specific functions. Synchronising data across the apps is possible, but it is again tedious, time-consuming, and difficult. This project’s second motivation aims to resolve these issues, so that students can spend more time on studying and working on assignments. It could become a useful tool for students, serving as an all-in-one package for most student’s requirements.</p>

    <p>Finally, the project presents a valuable learning experience for the team, mimicking a real-world scenario where we could experiment with all the different components of software development. It would serve to develop our teamwork, programming skills, understanding of the development life cycle, project management skills, and other necessary soft skills.</p>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>As a productivity software app, core features of the app will be designed and implemented to handle notetaking, time-management, and project management. Additional features to supplement the app functionality include communication like Teams or Discord, in-built music/video and finally a contact list.</p>

    <ul>Feature #1: Notepad – Main feature  
        <li>Allow users to write and save text</li>
        <li>Has ability to customise e.g. change text colour, tables, centre text, change font size.</li>
        <li>Storage of notes will currently be as a text file due to it being the most simple and cheap method to use. 
            <li>Due to its plain text nature, risk of corruption is low and even in the case that an error occurs, it is still possible to recover the data more easily. It is also smaller and cheaper to maintain in terms of storage data </li>
            <li>It does raise issues of its inability for rich text formatting, which will cause issues with how it may be displayed once the file is re-opened in the app. Some back-end code to instruct how the file is read can alleviate this issue but will cost more time to build and implement </li>
        </li>
