    <h2>Van</h2>
    <p>Regarding what I thought went well during this assignment, practical planning of short-term tasks throughout the week, as well as being able to plan for the long term had a positive impression on me. I thought this was especially true during the tutorial. I also thought the process of team management from Bo was fair, concise and practical which also had a positive impression from me. Although the planning of the assignment was conceived from the beginning, we ran into quite a few roadblocks pertaining to progression and communication. Although running into troubles in completing tasks is understandable, communicating one's current progress as well as formulating it concretely in forms of uploading iterations of a task would have been helpful for all members in understanding our overall progress in the assignment, and ultimately, help avoid the need for "crunch time". This attribute of having work delayed for extended periods of time with no updates was also one of the things I found surprising from this assignment and has provided a good opportunity to learn more about team management and communication skills. Another aspect that I found surprising is the constant rearranging of team members, with 2 different team members that left midway. I have learned that every team is unique, and an important part of success correlates more with frequent communication, rather than technical abilities.</p>

    <p>I think what went well in the group was our consistency, we strived to meet once or twice a week and pretty much all these meetings went ahead on time with almost all group members involved. I also think that task allocation went to the most fit people to do these jobs, admittedly I’m not the most technical of people so having me do something like work on the HTML of the website (something I originally wanted to do) would’ve been admittedly a very bad idea, instead that job went to Russell, a literal professional web developer, and we didn’t even have to pay him. What could’ve been improved is everyone’s commitment to this assignment, I am not excluded from this criticism, I mentioned previously that almost everyone was present at meetings, admittedly there weren’t too many meetings were all five of us were present which made things like checking progress difficult at times. Something I found surprising was the amount of work that was required for this assignment in general, as well as the general formality of all the meetings. One major thing I’ve learned about groups is being in a group where each member has a different level of motivation to the goal can be incredibly frustrating.</p>

    <h2>Bo</h2>
    <p>My overall perception of the team has been negative. Firstly, each member of the team possesses unique skills which complements the other members and covers our weaknesses. Hayden and Russell both possess in-depth knowledge and experience with front-end development, website creation and programming. Van showed a great ability in researching and writing his ideas/findings in a clear professional manner. Daniel demonstrated the ability to have meaningful discussions during tutorials to generate ideas and concepts. This was a great advantage that we unfortunately failed to utilise the full potential of. During our assignment, we have had an ongoing issue of participation, organisation, and fulfilment of deadlines. Some members were not participating in meetings and in some cases the tutorial sessions. Combined with a lack of communication, this led to confusion of our expectations and a lack of direction. Progress was severely lacking for the first few weeks of the assignment and deadlines were not being met. What resulted from this is a crunch period dangerously close to our A2 submission deadline. Working with this group has been valuable experience especially as a leader. I believe if we address these issues and utilise our advantage of our team skillsets, A3 should be much easier to tackle. </p>
