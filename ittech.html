        <h2>Machine Learning</h2>

        <h3>What does it do? </h3>
        <p>Machine Learning is the process whereby an algorithm learns without being explicitly told what to do. Machine Learning is distinguished from the other sub-fields of Artificial Intelligence by being more “dependent on human intervention to learn”, IBM Cloud Education (2020). This prerequisite includes processes such as cleaning the dataset to be used and determining the featured variables to be used by the algorithm. The main purpose of Machine Learning is to form patterns by using data, and consequently, make recommendations and predictions for future outcomes.

    Before we discuss the state of Machine Learning today, looking back on some of the history can provide an insight on how for this field of study have come. Machine Learning was considered a part of Artificial Intelligence until the late 1970’s, (Foote, 2019), and was primarily used by researchers to train an Artificial Intelligence program. Since then, Machine Learning has shifted focus to solving practical problems by utilizing statistics and probability.

    There are 3 types of machine Learning: Supervised Learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforced learning.

    Supervised Learning is whereby the algorithm is trained on labelled data, such as the name of the column or feature and would learn based on the training data that is given. Supervised learning is primarily utilized in classification and regression problems such as predicting the prices of homes. In other words, supervised learning is the process of using labelled data, and outputting a prediction of known labels.

    Unsupervised learning is where the algorithm is trained with unlabelled data and is subcategorized into being a clustering model or dimensionality reduction model. The algorithm associates the similarities between data and groups them together based on these assumptions. For example, our model can filter between a non-fraudulent and a potentially fraudulent bank account based on their transaction histories.

    Lastly, Reinforcement Learning is where an agent is defined, and based on the actions of this action in an environment, it is rewarded or punished. This type of learning allows for the algorithm to learn based on trial and error and attempts to guide the agent to an optimal solution. An example is OpenAI Five, which is a Dota 2 AI that has learnt from reinforcement learning and has beaten the championship team 2-0.

    The current state of Machine Learning can be categorised into the following lists (Foote, 2019):
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Analysing Sales Data</li>
      <li>Real-Time Mobile Personalization </li>
      <li>Fraud Detection </li>
      <li>Product Recommendation </li>
      <li>Learning Management Systems </li>
      <li>Dynamic Pricing </li>
      <li>Natural Language Processing </li>
    </ul>

    <p>As the amount of data generated everyday increases, the demand by companies to capture and utilize this will also be expected to increase, with it being estimated that “48% of companies use data analysis, machine learning, or AI tools to address data quality issues” (Georgi Todorov). Businesses, small and large, are finding the increasing need to employ Machine Learning to better their business practice and to meet the changing customer needs.

    The current practice in the field of Machine Learning is to build different models depending on the problem. This process involves building the algorithm as well as collecting and processing data from scratch. This means that the deployment of a new machine learning model is expensive and time consuming. The lead of Google’s AI division, Jeff Dean believes that the “future of [Machine Learning] lies in a great big model, a multi-functioning model that can do plenty of things” (Benedict Neo, 2019). This concept revolves around the idea of training just a single model and training it do perform in different circumstances instead of the current practice of having an algorithm paired to a problem.

    Another development that may come to fruition in the future is the practice of using “Federated Data” (Bhagat, 2021) where the data used as the learning input for the algorithm is kept private. The current protocol for a Data Science Team is to use data from a centralised server such as the cloud. The negative implications of using the cloud to deploy machine learning models is that the models are accessing a database that also stores sensitive user information. The process of Federate Learning is facilitated by having your device download the model that you want to pass data into, and having the model learn from the data that is stored locally on your device, and not the data that is stored in the database.

    There are also other revolutionising technologies being developed that will affect the Machine Learning field such as Quantum Computing, where it would increase the efficiency of processing large amounts of data.
    </p>

      <h3>What is the likely impact? </h3>
      <p>The advent of new technologies always brings forward a betterment towards some aspect of society. Likewise, there will always be some level of concern and criticism towards new advancements. Machine Learning is no different. The positive impacts on society that Machine Learning may have includes areas such as Education, Smart Homes, and Business.

    To elaborate further, having smart classrooms and systems where reports can be “customized [and] report their specific needs” (Vijay Singh, 2020) helps with making education more personal to an individual and ultimately, teachers can teach the set curriculum alongside assisting in areas that students may find difficult. Using these types of Machine Learning tools in school would create jobs such as having a database administrator. The adverse implications of such tools in the classroom would include concerns such as the possibility of reducing the need for teacher assistants and consequently, may have unintended consequences to the supply of teachers, especially in places that report a shortage of teaching staff.




    Smart technologies within the home such as virtual assistants, light automation or automatic heating and cooling units, are becoming more popular and integrated within the household. Although they provide convenience and security, these devices are not free of concern. Having a virtual assistant hacked would be very problematic such as listening to private conversations or having credit cards and other accounts linked to the device stolen.

    In a business context, a company may decide to implement machine learning to help improve efficiency and better optimize the workplace. This would create opportunities for IT professionals such as data analysts, data scientist and database engineers. From a managerial perspective, this type of technology would be a non-issue, however, ethical problems may arise such as discriminatory outcomes or the lack of privacy. This could be weaponized by someone in HR with malicious intent, and wrongly terminate an individual.

    Additionally, another area where Machine Learning can improve the lives of people is public transportation. By using Machine Learning to predict what time a train, or other mode of transport arrives at a particular destination allows for better planning of transport timetabling. It could reduce the waiting time and travel time when commuting by bus or train, as well as taking optimal roads to avoid congestion. This would ultimately, increase the number of jobs for public transport operators.

    Although there are many great outcomes that can be harnessed using Machine Learning, controversial developments in the field are quite common. An example is China’s social credit system, and its reinforcement through Machine Learning enabled technology such as cameras and other monitoring devices. Punishing bad behavior such as jaywalking or not paying one’s bills on time are all monitored and consequently, an individual’s every action is rewarded or punished. This type of utilization incites concern over one’s privacy and data protection issues such as the concern of being constantly surveilled, possibly even in a private environment such as one’s home. Although the crime rate in such an environment would be expected to drop, the associated payoffs in one’s livability would also plunder.
    </p>

    <h3>How will this affect you? </h3>

    <p>There are many developments in the Machine Learning field that have piqued our interest, such as smart homes or optimizing in the public transportation system. Optimization in public transport, development of smart homes and personalization are just a few developments that would improve one’s life. As a student, it would allow for better planning in travel when using public transport, better learning experiencing and opportunities to improve my abilities in school, as well as improvements in convenience that is brought by automation.

    Regarding what would be different in wake of Machine Learning being implemented in my daily life, I believe that most of the changes would revolve around convenience, security, and personalization. In Australia, it is fortunate that there are huge emphasizes on ethical and practical applications of new technologies. They should comply with existing laws and regulations. Therefore, although there exists some concern with security and information privacy, they are mainly “what if” hypotheticals.




    Machine Learning brings about an opportunity for companies to maximize their profits and ensure a better alignment with customer demands. From the employee perspective, it incites fear or making one’s own skillset and knowledge obsolete and being replaced or made redundant. This sentiment is mostly felt throughout low-skilled jobs such as truck drivers, factory workers and others. Having some friends and family in this category makes me anxious for their future in the industry.

    Other friends and family in the business and tech industry are not invulnerable to the changes that machine learning can bring to the workplace. The positive changes revolve around the idea of utilizing new technologies in Machine Learning to automate some aspects of their lives, such as a Data Scientist automating the data processing tasks, which in turn, allows for time to be reallocated to address business solutions. Conversely, people who are affected by machine learning in business, should expect that their roles are business professionals to evolve along with this change. Therefore, there may be concerns of some positions merging with others to produce a new role, which effectively makes a two-person job into one. For instance, the employment of Automated Machine Learning could potentially result in the data analyst role removed entirely, and its responsibilities to be conferred onto the data scientist.

    <h2>Robots</h2>

    <h3>What does it do? </h3>
    <p>Robots are machines that are programmed to carry out a specific set of tasks as a substitute to human labor.

    According to the Robotics Institute of America, robots can be classified into the following:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Variable-Sequence: Robots that performs successive stages of a task defined by an underlying function. The controls to the robot can be modified. </li>
      <li>Playback: Controlled by human operator and acts as an extension tool. This type of robot usually replicates those actions performed by humans. </li>
      <li>Numerical control: Robot that is controlled by numbers. Usually controlled through a computer. </li>
      <li>Intelligent: Ability to adapt to environment and perform efficiently without a human operator </li>

    </ul>

    <p>From the above classifications, the way we address robots could further be simplified in being Industrial robots or Autonomous robots.

    Industrial Robots are employed in a plethora of industries, but most prominently, in the manufacturing industry. When the term robots come up in conversation in this context, one would think of high precision robots that are controlled by human operators or programmers such as an assembly robot arm. The benefit of using this technology in business, improves facets such as precision of movement and placement in assembling materials, improved safety as dangerous jobs are handled by robotic members, and reducing long-term costs in labor (“6 Major Types of Industrial Robots Used in the Global Manufacturing 2018”). Ultimately, the use of robotics in these fields provide with a higher quality of a product.

    We can also infer benefits of using industrial robots over human capital in the context of coronavirus. When a person becomes infected, the production line is adversely affected. Having a person away from their position becomes a liability for a manager, where the worse possible outcome would be to suspend operations until the individual’s full recovery. This provides justification in using industrial robots as production line will not be affected.

    Industrial robots are not intelligent and are usually only programmed to perform a fixed number of tasks, especially if they are repetitive. For a robot to be classified as an intelligent system, it needs to meet certain conditions such as being able to achieve its goals with human intervention, to be able to make their own decisions based on sensor information and to be able to adjust its decision making based on a changing environment. We can see autonomous robots being implementing in the service industry such as robot waiters that bring food to the table, AI robots that enable smart warehouses such as Amazon and cleaning robots such as the Roomba.

    In recent years, autonomous robots are also making strides in aspects such as aged care and mobility-oriented robots. The Japanese Therapeutic robot, Paro, developed to assist with relaxing and motivating patients in age care (“7 Latest Innovations in Robotics”) with the capability to learn names, can learn to communicate to frequent words and phrases used towards it, as well as being able to show emotions.

    The use of robots in healthcare has become common practice now, with tools such as surgical assistant robots. “These robots help surgeons achieve new levels of speed and accuracy” (“Robotics in Healthcare: The Future of Robots in Medicine”) which are powered by Artificial Intelligence and vision technologies. There are a copious number of precautions that need considered a during a procedure such as avoid nerves and muscles, as well as the time complexities to avoid infections in an open surgery. Hospitals have employed robots to assist with operations with hopes in the future to have fully autonomous machines to carry out simple procedures.

    Boston Dynamic’s “Spot” robot can traverse through unfamiliar terrain, avoid obstacles, and climb stairs, enabled through its use of sensors and not human input (“About | Boston Dynamics”). Spot can also be employed by the police to identify potentially dangerous and unidentifiable packages which highlights the extent to where Autonomous robots can be applied may extend one’s expectations.

    The prospects of robots in the future are looking promising, regarding both industrial robots and autonomous robots. Firstly, the market for industrial robots is projected to rise from USD 45 billion in 2020 to USD 119 billion by 2030 (“2021 Upcoming Trends and Future of Industrial Robotics Market | RoboticsTomorrow”). Based on this projection, the future of manufacturing industries such as automotive and electronics are shown to have an increasing emphasis on its integration of better and more state-of-the-art industrial robots. Although the manufacturing industry is expected be the biggest embracer of such robots, companies in other industries such as hospitality have also begun to value the importance of robots in their workflow. For instance, Japan Airlines have begun testing the use of remotely controlled robots named “JET”, where the operator controls the robot at home, to assist customers. This initiative has come as a direct response to the ongoing pandemic.

    The future applications of robotics can also extend to the military, with prototypes of exoskeletons, small drones, AI integrated unmanned drones and materials handling systems to name a few (Demaitre). Although in the early stages of development, these ventures being explored by the US military illustrates a future state of warfare with super soldiers and robotics weaponry.

    With the current developments of robotics in practically every industry, it is to be expected soon, organizations will ramp up their business strategies to incorporate robots to optimize and innovate their current workflow.

    The increasing trend towards a collaborative working environment with robots is being enabled by a “combination of AI, machine learning, and contextually rich data delivered by sensors” (Techbriefs Media). In addition to this, the decrease in costs for integrating these systems, such as more affordable and compact sensors also have a contribution towards this change. Empowering real time data collected through these sensors and cameras allows for these robots to better react to their surroundings.

    Modern processors allow for more computations to be computed. This results in tasks and instructions being processed and completed faster. This means that the robot can command its limbs to move faster, more accurately and more responsive to its surroundings. Advancements and innovation in the development of new materials that stronger, more lightweight, and more flexible also contribute to the development of modern robotics. Additionally, better battery designs that are lighter and allow for more efficient storage of energy also plays a big role in the physical structure and physics that are considered when developing a robot.

    The development of programming languages has also helped in modernizing robotics. The addition of libraries and frameworks that specialize in fields such as image processing, allows engineers to easily implement and fine tune the robot’s functions.
    </p>

    <h3>What is the likely impact? </h3>

    <p>Robots can leave many positive impacts upon a society. For the companies, it provides an opportunity to increase their efficiency and quality of their products. Having high precision machinery that can perform exponentially better than its human counterpart in the production line nets business owners with higher profits and a safer work environment are some of the reasons for why a manufacturer may decide to incorporate robots. This would change the workflow drastically, to be centered around improving the performance and productivity of robots, allowing for the possibility to operate 24/7, without facing human labor issues and the like.

    Conversely, the fear of being made redundant has only become stronger. Besides the merits of providing a safer working environment, by having robots take on more dangerous tasks, robots provide little utility and merit for the workers, and especially for blue collar workers.

    The surge of implementing robots in our workforce has implications in every industry, albeit some affected more heavily. For instance, blue collar jobs are more likely to be adversely affected with robots taking over the production line, leaving many displaced. Additionally, many of these workers only have skills specific towards operating certain machines, and with manufacturers such as the automobile sector embracing a forward approach towards autonomous robots, finding another job becomes proportionately difficult.

    Researchers have found that “for every robot added per 1,000 workers in the U.S., wages declined by 0.42%, with a loss of 400,000 to date” (Brown). This reality paints a stark picture of the potential for many other industrials to follow in suit.

    The blue-collar job will be the ones that feel the most adverse effects because of an usher of robots replacing their roles. However, office jobs would also be vulnerable to this development, especially for roles that involve repetitive tasks such as clerical work. For example, ATMs are replacing bank tellers when an individual wants to deposit or withdraw their money. Paralegals are also finding their roles in going through legal documents being replaced by robots that can perform the same duties, but exponentially faster.

    Robots are eliminating the need for labor in meticulous and repetitive task, which allows for the reallocation of resources in a critical thinking and creative role. Additionally, the demand for expertise in STEM is likely to be the byproduct of robotic integration in the workplace.

    Industries such as healthcare will also see improvements. Having robots that can operate with greater effectiveness in common injuries will allow for more lives saved, as well as providing doctors with more time and resources in more complex operations and problems.
    </p>

    <h3>How will this affect you? </h3>

    <p>Students in STEM less to worry about regarding the paranoia of robots taking over our jobs. It may be true to some extent, especially small and time-consuming tasks, but in turn, would allow for more time spent on complex problems as well as critical-thinking tasks. Furthermore, robots allow for the opportunity to upskill in areas such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence, electrical engineering, and other relevant skills.

    With an increase demand in STEM professionals, it could be expected for economies all over the world to increase their pay expectations in these roles. For me and those who would want to travel whilst working but are held back by salary differences between regions, this trend would enable for such opportunities.

    A robotics integrated society such as food delivery robots or cleaning robots would free up more time in my personal life, and consequently, allows for more time spent on hobbies and family. Yet despite its convenience, it would also increase my concerns on data privacy. I would be more conscientious regarding expressing thoughts into words if robots with microphone I/O or cameras were present and the paranoia of being constantly surveilled would become an ongoing concern.

    Having friends and family in blue-collared jobs provides concerns for the future, especially when their skills are often limited to their current occupation. In the scenario of losing, one’s job, the concern of being able to find another job predominately remains unchanged. This can cause tremendous collateral damage, such as not being able to the home mortgage, or finance for their future.

    Contrastingly, elderly friends and family will net a positive from this society. The shortage of caretakers can somewhat be solved, with the innovation of robots in this industry. Issues such as loneliness, as well as food preparation can be resolved with this technology. Additionally, this would mean that care-houses are not the only viable options and would allow one to be at ease if their elderly beneficiary would prefer to look after themselves.

    <h2>Blockchain and Cryptocurrency</h2>
    <h3>What is it?</h3>
    <p>Bitcoin, Ethereum, Doge, you’ve heard of them before - they are all well-known and highly publicized forms of cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency or “Crypto” as popularly termed, is a form of virtual currency that is stored, transacted, and verified on highly secure decentralized networks based on the blockchain technology. They are not dependent on any authority (such as governments or corporations) to uphold it, making it less vulnerable to manipulation and there-for, the control of the currency lies in the holders of the crypto – decentralization.

    The blockchain network that these currencies operate on is essentially a distributed digital ledger that stores all the previous transactions. These networks are highly secure databases of information and are next to impossible to manipulate.

    Blocks are nothing but a group of records (e.g., crypto transactions), that also stores information about the previous block in the chain (normally in a form of a hash). The record stored in each block is dependent on which type of blockchain it is. For example, bitcoin’s blockchain stores data which shows the sender, receiver, and amount of each bitcoin transaction.

    Each block has a hash, you can think of each block as having a fingerprint (hash) that is unique to each block which also identifies all its contents. Alongside this, blocks store the ‘fingerprint’ of the previous block as well, and in this way, if the information within the previous block is tampered (causing its fingerprint to change), the rest of the blockchain will be false.

    To add a new block to the chain, computers must generate the hash (mentioned earlier) for each block. Generating a hash takes time and computational effort (bitcoin takes on average 10 minutes per block)– which is what crypto miners do. This process of creating hashes is difficult enough that manipulating entire sets of blocks is unfeasible – but verifying them is not. This process is called “Proof of Work”, and rewards miners with cryptocurrencies.

    Blockchains also operate on a peer-to-peer network. When a peer is added to the network – it receives a copy of the full blockchain (ledger of all transactions). This method of distribution means that all the peers in the network work to decide and verify that the current blockchain is correct. Manipulating data on a blockchain network is next to impossible, as you would need to not only compute an entire blockchain with the proof of work required, but also infiltrated more than 50% of the peers on the global network.
    </p>

    <h3>What can be done now?</h3>
    <p>With all the different types of cryptocurrencies in circulation, some might wonder what are some of the major uses for each type?

    Major cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and Ethereum can be used to complete fast and cheap money transfers. The low transaction fees and speedy transfer times allow cryptos to be an excellent medium in cross-border (international) transactions, undercutting the fees required by banks or financial intermediaries that would’ve also taken potentially business days to clear.

    made on cryptocurrency networks are also completely anonymous, with no name or id tied to the crypto wallets that store the cryptos. Holders can make large transactions to other wallets without the need to justify them to a bank.

    Some companies such as Microsoft, Twitch and AT&T have started accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for their services. Even some fast-food outlets in certain regions have begun accepting bitcoin as a form of payment. Although you cannot go to a brick-and-mortar store and order food, KFC Canada for example allowed bitcoin payment for its “bitcoin bucket” which was delivered straight to the recipient’s home address.

    Other than transactions, cryptocurrencies are currently a popular form of investment. The high-volatility nature of the price of crypto makes it a target choice for many day traders – with an increasing amount of medium to long term holders emerging. Many individuals will still view cryptocurrency as a commodity too risky to include in their folios, with factors such as PR marketing and social media having too much of a role to play in the price of crypto. A perfect example of this is when Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, had tweeted “SpaceX is going to put a literal Dogecoin on the literal moon”. Prices had jumped from a trading value of 5 US cents to as high as 75 cents.
    </p>

    <h3>Future implications and advancements</h3>
    <p>Cryptocurrency and the connected blockchain technology have the potential to be implicated into many industries – revolutionizing the way data is stored, ridding the risk of manipulation, and increasing security with greater efficiency.

    In the future, application focused blockchains such as Ethereum and Cardano aim to transform, automate and synergies transactions in industries using smart contracts. These contracts allow the creation of decentralized applications (dApps). Smart contracts are essentially automated code that execute when the predefined conditions are met – this means that all participants involved in a smart contract can be certain of the outcome of the transaction – with no intermediaries involved. For example: in real estate, once a buyer pays the seller for a property, all the normally needed paperwork, tasks, administration is all immediately carried out by the smart contracts. This saves immense amounts of labor – while the tasks are carried out extremely quickly and void of error.
    One lucrative idea that may be implicated soon, is ‘blockchain voting’ for democratic electoral systems (such as used in Australia). The idea is that voting on an election will be counted and stored on a blockchain network. This ensures that the election is completely verifiably fair, and that each person can only vote once and only under their name. Blockchain voting will result in elections that are counted extremely quickly, provably fair, and essentially safeguards it against any form of corruption or manipulation.

    These sorts of technologies already exist – but developments in current infrastructure must be made to accommodate for large scale use. The biggest hurdle is that crypto in general needs to gain widespread acceptance amongst the public to be used in large public systems – whether it be for voting or money transactions in businesses. On top of this, acceptance of crypto will not happen unless stability of the currency is implemented – protecting consumers who want to use the currency. This form of stability can only be achieved with some type of regulation from governments and large financial institutions – the problem here being it goes against the fundamental principles of cryptocurrency, decentralization!
    </p>

    <h3>Impact of Cryptocurrency</h3>
    <p>The impact of these developments, as mentioned earlier, will result in a financial system that is efficient, secure and reliable.

    The biggest industry that will undergo change is unsurprisingly the banking industry. As people adopt new crypto technologies, they will store their money on these platforms – and not in banks. Many major banks have already started to adopt and develop their own central bank digital currencies – which utilize the blockchain technology in providing streamlined financial services.

    Smart contracts will eliminate the need for intermediaries in many industries, with jobs in real estate, travel and insurance being at risk. Document Couriers for example, will be a job that will not be needed. Any job connected to office administration, verification and certification will be in danger – as all the transactions will be verified by the blockchain network. Company Auditing of finances will be a thing of the past, if entire businesses ran operations on blockchain networks.

    As technology progresses, many jobs are often made unnecessary – with much of the mundane being effortlessly carried out by machines. With this, comes the creation of much more job opportunity. When horses were replaced by cars, sure - many horse-related jobs were made irrelevant –but more car-related jobs emerged instead. Similarly, the demand for engineers, developers, marketers and communicators within the scope of cryptocurrency will increase as this technology becomes more and more implemented into society.

    </p>


    <h3>Personal Impact</h3>
    <p>In terms of our daily everyday lives, business related operations and routine will be made effortless with otherwise tedious processes made automated. In the far future, smart contracts will be in place to automate everything from our tax returns to sorting out refunds for say – a delayed flight. We can make transactions and be ensured that things will happen exactly as calculated. Our speed of bank transfers to one another will be extremely quick, no need to wait business days to transfer funds to another bank.

    A reduced risk of fraud – due to the blockchain recording all transactions, will encourage ecommerce businesses to thrive as more users will be less deterred to shop online. This not only positively affects some of us as business owners, but also provides peace of mind to consumers.

    One particularly negative outcome of the implications of this technology includes the enabling of organized criminal activities. Since complete anonymity between crypto transactions exist, this allows criminals to easily traffic drugs, humans, money (laundering) and other contraband such as weapons. Criminals that exploit cryptocurrencies to fuel their illegal purposes only detract our quality of life.

    <h2>Autonomous Vehicles</h2>
    <h3>What is it?</h3>
    <p>The notion of self-driving cars is something of a science-fiction fantasy to some, but the reality is that they’re much closer to commercial deployment than most would think! An autonomous or more accurately defined “fully automated car” is a vehicle that uses environmental sensing technology in order to operate the vehicle without the need of any human interaction. That is, it is fully capable of driving to any location (even off road) and can drive in any fashion that an adept human driver is able to do.

    Autonomous vehicles function by employing a range of different sensors to ensure an accurate map of their immediate surroundings – including other pedestrians and vehicles. Sophisticated video imaging is used to read traffic lights, road signs, other vehicles and to spot pedestrians. This is synergized with radar technologies to track the position of surrounding vehicles. Lidar sensors (like radar but uses lasers) are used to measure the distances from other objects (vehicles, road edges and buildings), as well as keeping the car within appropriate lanes. Ultrasonic sensors installed in the wheels of the vehicle are used to detect curbs and other vehicles when parking. All these sensors are computed using complex onboard software to manage the cars steering, acceleration and braking – with other predictive modelling and algorithms to ensure a safe, efficient and ultimately flawless ride.
    </p>

    <h3>What can be done now?</h3>
    <p>In current-day self-driving cars, only partially automated systems have been successfully deployed commercially. These vehicles would be classified as “level 3 automation” self-driving cars – according to a system devised by SAE International. This system denotes levels of automation from Level 1, driver assistance – such as cruise control on a car, all the way to a maximum of Level 5, where a vehicle can perform any driving task without any human interaction. A Level 3 vehicle as deployed by Waymo in late 2020, can effectively drive without human interaction with full environmental detection capabilities – but still requires input as to which path to take, where to go and is restricted to geofenced locations.

    Another company, Cruise, are currently testing and developing their line of Level 4-5 autonomous vehicles. The Cruise Origin as it is called, is a purpose-built vehicle designed for ride-hailing and contains no manual steering options. The mass production of these cars has been scheduled to begin in 2023, with petitions partnering with General Motors to begin building and deploying the Origin being lodged this year.


    One other licensed service called Nuro, which was founded by 2 engineers that developed the Waymo project, specializes in autonomous delivery vehicles. In April 2020, Nuro begun deployment of their R2 AV – which was used to transport medical supplies to and from facilities in California.

    <h3>Future implications and advancements</h3>

    <p>The next step in autonomous vehicle technologies includes the ability for the cars to drive on faster highway roads. In a survey conducted by McKinsey, 75 executives working in autonomous driving projects worldwide were surveyed in their response to the future technologies regarding AVs. On average, survey responses showed that most companies expected use cases of Level 4 Vehicles using highways and parking in garages by 2024 – 2025.

    Although the use of AVs in package delivery has been prototyped and evaluated, large scale commercial use such as driverless trucks (that can use highways) are expected to start seeing implementation by as early as 2027.

    By 2028, the same group of companies predicted that L5 taxis will be in use in urban areas in the form of ride sharing services.

    To make these goals a possibility – the technology required must be implemented to a higher standard, especially when dealing with faster speeds and larger areas to traverse. This means sharper sensors, and more intelligent algorithmic software that can handle higher number of use cases (on road situations). This software must be able to handle split second decision making – almost to akin to humans when driving on roads. For example, humans can distinguish pedestrian action (for example: if someone is going to cross the road Infront)) by the look on their faces, pace of travel and other behavioral factors. AVs must be on par in this regard with being able to predict pedestrian actions – all within fractions of a second if necessary.

    In the same survey mentioned earlier, respondents had been asked as to what the biggest bottleneck to AVs would be. 60% of the respondents had mentioned that regulation will be the biggest bottleneck – rather than technological limits or a lack of customer demand for such services.

    In terms of critical hardware components, Lidar components, performance chips and hardware accelerators were deemed to be the most important. The production of these parts – along with new development tool chains are required to fuel faster development cycles and host better simulations (for predictive software dev.).

    <h3>Impact of Autonomous Vehicles</h3>

    <p>This type of automotive development will see a paradigm shift in the way we view travelling by road. In the short term, AVs increase the safety of travelling via car – with sophisticated technologies in place to prevent accidents from happening. Dangerous driving – whether speeding or under the influence will no longer be a factor as human drivers become a thing of the past. Public acceptance of AVs will steadily rise as more and more services become available.

    Driverless cars are predicted to save over 35000 lives in the US alone per year. This is because an extreme percentage of fatal car accidents are attributed to human error (>94%). An interesting consequence from this, is that 15% of all organ donations used to save lives come from victims of car accidents. Medical sectors will need to find solutions – possibly making amendments to organ sale prohibitions, to counteract this loss of organ donations.

    As increased AVs are rolled out, the demand for conventional piloted cars will decrease. In turn, conventional automotive companies will see a reduction in demand for their products (possibly resulting in less jobs in the sales and manufacturing of conventional cars). The ride sharing industry, including taxi/uber drivers will be phased out – as thousands can potentially lose their jobs to AVs. The rise of autonomous vehicles may see the collapse of the current traditional auto industry.

    In the far future, when driverless cars are the only vehicles on our roads, motor accidents will become minimal, as our network of coordinated AVs will run in coordination. Roadside infrastructure such as signs, traffic lights, speed bumps and possibly even road lines will all become obsolete as technology advances. Hypothetically, perfect autonomous driving will also diminish the effect of traffic jams – as cars accelerate and brake synchronously.

    <h3>Personal Impact</h3>
    <p>The personal impact of autonomous vehicles on everyday lives will be profound and will revolutionize the automotive industry, along with how humans view road travel. We can expect to travel confidently on roads with a greater sense of safety. Daily commuting will become more efficient, with quicker travel times as traffic jams become outdated. Having your hands and mind free whilst commuting will lead to greater productivity – as you can complete work or tasks – leading to a more relaxed lifestyle. Since you are no longer driving, the risk of receiving parking or speeding fines is a non-issue.

    In the short term, humans will have to adapt on the roads to driving with AVs alongside us. This means potentially driving more carefully and predictably as the AVs progress to operating safely in unpredictable and complex human driving environments.



    Our methodology in purchasing cars will be drastically different, prioritizing safety and internal cabin features rather than the look and feel of our cars. Subscription based services that allow you to summon cars to your location may become a reality – ridding of the need to own vehicles.

    One exciting prospect of owning an AV is that in the future, your car may become your personal assistant in conducting tasks all day you would otherwise need to complete. For example, while you are at work, your car can pick up groceries, chauffeur your kids from school to home, deliver your mail to the post office and be back at 5 o’clock to drive you home from work. Refueling your car no longer becomes your responsibility- as your AV will automatically drive out potentially at night to refuel itself – the same can be said with other maintenance related tasks such as washing or repairs.
